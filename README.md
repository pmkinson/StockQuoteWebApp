# StockQuoteWebApp
Simple jsp servlet app to retrieve stocks quotes.

The app uses Yahoo-Finance API to query and retrieve user requests.

Planned Implementations:
1) Done - Adding the hibernate framework to add database functionality.
2) Done - Preemptive stock symbol matching in search box.  This will be done by auto updating listed stocks from the DowJones/Nasdaq indexes. They provide a list updated daily in an xml format.
3) Adding a simple CMS for user accounts and administration. 
4) Done - Better UI/UX with interactive graphs.
